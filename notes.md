# Loose original pitch
- Stealth game! no preference of 1st or 3rd person, I really like dishonored but i think the first person stealth would be difficult to work with
- game where you play as a rat/cat/other critter stealthing around a scaled-down environment, e.g. hiding under desks or walking around bookshelves

# Timeline
11 Nov - 5 Dec: production (four weeks)

Dec 6th: hard deadline (submit game or fail)

Dec 12th: Festival!

# Mouse game

## tasks for mouse game:
- find productivity/kanban software
    - is trello still good?
- concepting
- normal movement
- rat models
- camera controller
    - object clipping
        - when to punch in and when to hide objects
            - object hiding system
- side surface movement
- side surface camera controller
- around corner movement
    - convex
    - concave
    - overrides for very small differences in depth
        - might just have to be done in models? idk
- bottom surface movement
- bottom surface camera controller
- "the toy" is done at this point

- level design
    - environment models
    - textures
- stealth gameplay
    - detection system
    - enemy movement
- look at level design again to consider stealth gameplay
- win/lose conditions
- enemy models
- sound effects and music
    - sound effects system
    - "you're spotted" music system
- animations and polish


## AI
- state machine
    - patrol, alert, chase, attack states
- visual and audible senses for ai agents - LOS and AOE + movement speed checks
- hierarchical state machine
    - patrol has sub states, alert/chase can be sub states, attack can be a mini state machine
- easy: enums and switch-case
- hard: states are objects using events and callbacks (link in slides)
- behavior trees
    - unity asset store has a behavior tree tool :)
- pathfinding
    - A* search algorithm (best-first heuristic search algorithm)
    - NavMesh = fancy grid a search algorithm can use
        - can be generated by unity
        - can add weights and closable areas
        - there's an exercise on canvas for it
